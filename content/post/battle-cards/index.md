"[Battle Cards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rockbite.battlecards)" was an incredible journey that began at the [Playcrafting NYC Game Jam 2021](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/realtime-battlecards-9).  Our team managed to create a compelling multiplayer prototype in just two days, earning recognition from the judges. Built with Java, LibGDX, and a Node.js backend, we had a solid foundation for a full release. Seeing the positive response, we decided to take "Battle Cards" to the next level. After a year of dedicated development, we launched a polished version that players genuinely enjoyed.

My contributions centered on the UI, ensuring new features, code refactoring, and optimizations all worked toward a seamless player experience. However, being part of a small team meant I got to wear many hats! I contributed to gameplay programming, designed some eye-catching VFX, and tweaked the backend for better performance.  For our marketing efforts, I created a compact 2MB playable ad to showcase the heart of the game.

Additionally, I collaborated closely with our analytics team to improve dashboards, graphs, filters, and other tools.  Our goal was to make analyzing user experience more accessible, enabling us to make informed game design changes.  Ultimately, my focus was on making sure "Battle Cards" didn't just look good – it had to play well too. It was a challenging, yet incredibly rewarding project.

Let me know if you'd like any other adjustments – this is your showcase, and I want it to be a perfect reflection of your work!
